Drawing on over 15 years of experience, leading wireless communications researcher Henry Bertoni presents the most complete discussion of techniques for predicting radio propagation ever published. From its insightful introduction on spectrum reuse to its state-of-the-art real-world models for buildings, terrain, and foliage, Radio Propagation for Modern Wireless Systems delivers invaluable information for every wireless system designer. Coverage provides: A door to the understanding of radio wave propagation for the wireless channel. In-depth study of the effects on path loss of buildings, terrain, and foliage. A unified view of key propagation effects in narrowband and wideband systems, including spatial variation, angle of arrival, and delay spread. Readable account of diffraction at building corners, with worked out examples. Never-before-published coverage of mobile-to-mobile path loss in cities. Effective new ray-based models for site-specific predictions and simulation of channel statistics. Simulations of fast fading and shadow loss. From start to finish, Radio Propagation for Modern Wireless Systems presents sophisticated models?and compares their results with actual field measurements. With thorough coverage and extensive examples from both narrowband and wideband systems, it can help any wireless designer deliver more powerful, cost-effective services.},

abstract = {In hostile environment, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) could be disturbed by intentional jamming. Many adaptive algorithms have been developed to deal with these threats, among which use of antenna arrays is one of the most efficient. However, most of them have been designed under stationary hypothesis and their performances in harsher environments are questionable. For instance, when a GNSS receiver is placed near rotating bodies, the signal undergo complex and non-stationary effects called Rotor Blade Modulation (RBM). These variations can degrade significantly anti-jamming performance. This paper investigates the impact of the RBM on three conventional space-time adaptive processing (STAP). First, to simulate the RBM, the signal received by an antenna mounted on a helicopter is computed thanks to electromagnetic (EM) asymptotic methods. Then, to quantify precisely the loss in performance of each algorithm, we compare post correlation carrier to noise ratio (post - C/N0) and covariance matrix estimation with respect of the time. Finally, the simulation results are confirmed by experiments conducted on an EC-120 helicopter with an L-band Continuous Wave (CW) jammer.},

abstract = {Image synthesis, or rendering, is a field of transformation: it changes geometry and physics into meaningful images. Because the most popular algorithms frequently change, it is increasingly important for researchers and implementors to have a basic understanding of the principles of image synthesis. Focusing on theory, Andrew Glassner provides a comprehensive explanation of the three core fields of study that come together to form digital image synthesis: the human visual system, digital signal processing, and the interaction of matter and light. Assuming no more than a basic background in calculus, Glassner transforms his passion and expertise into a thorough presentation of each of these disciplines, and their elegant orchestration into modern rendering techniques such as radiosity and ray tracing.},

abstract = {This paper highlights the extraction of micro-Doppler (m-D) features from radar signal returns of helicopter and human targets using the wavelet transform method incorporated with time-frequency analysis. In order for the extraction of m-D features to be realised, the time domain radar signal is decomposed into a set of components that are represented at different wavelet scales. The components are then reconstructed by applying the inverse wavelet transform. After the separation of m-D features from the target's original radar return, time-frequency analysis is then used to estimate the target's motion parameters. The autocorrelation of the time sequence data is also used to measure motion parameters such as the vibration/rotation rate. The findings show that the results have higher precision after the m-D extraction rather than before it, since only the vibrational/rotational components are employed. This proposed method of m-D extraction has been successfully applied to helicopter and human data.},

@article{Whitted1979,
abstract = {To accurately render a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene, global illumination information that affects the intensity of each pixel of the image must be known at the time the intensity is calculated. In a simplified form, this information is stored in a tree of "rays" extending from the viewer to the first surface encountered and from there to other surfaces and to the light sources. A visible surface algorithm creates this tree for each pixel of the display and passes it to the shader. The shader then traverses the tree to determine the intensity of the light received by the viewer. Consideration of all of these factors allows the shader to accurately simulate true reflection, shadows, and refraction, as well as the effects simulated by conventional shaders. Anti-aliasing is included as an integral part of the visibility calculations. Surfaces displayed include curved as well as polygonal surfaces.},

abstract={This thesis investigates a method of tracking remote transmitters using multipath localization ?ngerprints generated by a ray tracing simulation. Radio wave propagation phenomena in a dense urban environment can be simulated using publicly available mapping data and 2-D ray tracing techniques when the receivers and transmitters are found to be approximately co-planar. OpenStreetMap (OSM) building data is used to model the area of interest, and frequency of arrival (FOA) localization ?ngerprints are generated virtually along a grid. These ?ngerprints are then used to estimate the origin of incoming signals. Simulation of this method using three receivers and a 10 m square grid demonstrates a simulated localization accuracy within 15 m. Taking things a step closer to reality, an attempt to validate the ray tracing simulation is made. Validation is presented in the form of experimental results for a set of trials along with a statistical comparison to simulation results. A signi?cant positive correlation between the experimental and simulation results is found and detailed. Finally, the tracking method described is applied to real collected signal data and the results discussed.},
