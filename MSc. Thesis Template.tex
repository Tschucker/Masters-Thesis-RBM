In RF communications with a rotorcraft, such as a helicopter, the rotor blades can impart a modulation onto the received signal called Rotor Blade Modulation (RBM). This modulation is caused by the reflection of a signal off the rotating blades. The reflected signal is Doppler shifted based on where the signal is reflected along the length of the blade as well as the angle between the axis of rotation and the emitter. RBM is known to degrade the performance of RF communications on rotorcraft and can be used in RADAR applications to detect and classify aircraft, but there is little on its usefulness in other areas.This project will look at the ability to utilize the RBM phenomenon on the rotorcraft itself to geo-locate and track a signal emitter on the ground. To do this a RF ray tracing program was developed in C++ to produce a simulation of the RBM.
